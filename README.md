# A_Simple_Monitor_on_windows10
This repo is my first repo :joy:. So say something to remenber it. 

It is a simple python program to monitor your PC. It can provide CPU load, memory, GPU memory, network download speed. 

Why do I do it. Because I hate rogue softwares, likes 360, Tencent, Kingsoft and so on. Thet will send many ads to me and install third-party softwares on my PC without my consent.I hate them. However I need their monitors to monitor my PC which overloads. So why can I not own my monitor by myself?

Step: 
- pip install wmi, psutil, pynvml
- click Anaconda Prompt
- cd /path/to/this/program
- python ./monitor_win.py

TODO: 
- Pack it to an exe and it can show at top of windows always.
- Design an UI and we can interact with it.
